      <h2>Home page content</h2>
      <p>The home page serves as the central hub of a website, offering visitors a first impression and an overview of the site's purpose. It typically features a clear navigation menu, highlighting key sections like products, services, or information. A welcoming message, hero image, or call-to-action (CTA) often draws users' attention to important features or content. The design is clean and intuitive to encourage easy exploration and engagement. A good home page also provides quick access to essential information, such as contact details, social media links, or user login. Ultimately, it sets the tone for the entire site and ensures a seamless user experience.
